# Weather and Climate

## Difference

**Weather** refers to the day-to-day changes in the atmospheric conditions of an area.

**Climate** refers to the average conditions of the weather which has been recorded over a long peroid of time, usually over 30 years.

The main difference between weather and climate is that weather is measured at a point in time, while climate is measured over a period of time.

<p class="shadowed">The main difference is the time period. Weather is constantly changing whilst climate is somewhat permanent.</p>

## Extreme Weather

**Extreme weather** is an unpredictable weather event which significantly differs from the average or normal weather.

It is severe and encompasses hurricanes, floods, and droughts.

Can be explained by a wide range of factors which include climate change.

### Hurricanes

Hurricane season spans from June 01 to September 30 and Hurricanes can form in the
- **Caribbean**
- **West Coast of Africa**
- **Eastern Atlantic**  
and form under the conditions of low atmospheric preassure, warm waters, and tropical wind patterns.
