# Climate Change

## Definitions

**Climate Change** refers to the change in global or regional climate patterns which has become more obvious from the late 20th century to present, a change due mainly to human activity.

**Greenhouse Effect** refers to the trapping of heat from the sun in the earth's atmosphere by a layer of gases including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.

These gases allow incoming sunlight to pass through but retain most of the heat radiated back from the earth's surface, causing the greenhouse effect

**Global Warming** refers to the gradual increase in global temperatures over the last century.

The temperature has increased by an averge of 0.6Â°C over the 20th century, this is due mainly to increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greesehouse gases.

## Impact of Global Warming and Climate Change In the Caribbean

Longer, more frequent, and more severe droughts can cause food shortages and economic disruption in the Caribbean. This will also impact the income of farmers, as they will be unable to cultivate and sell more crops. The Caribbean is home to numerous low-lying nations. This will result in coastal flooding due to the rising sea level. This can harm coastal communities and force some individuals to become homeless. As a result of weather conditions such as hurricanes, flooding, and storm surge, recreational fishermen will no longer be able to fish at sea.
